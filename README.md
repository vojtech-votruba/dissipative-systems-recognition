# How to run
After cloning the repository we need to run

    python3 simulate_trajectory.py
	
it has some aditional arguments which can be found in the code.

This script should generate a folder called "data" with a file "dataset.txt" inside of it.
After that we can train the model using

    python3 learn_and_compare.py
